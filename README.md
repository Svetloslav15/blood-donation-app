# blood-donation-app
This is my application that I built with ASP .NET CORE 2.2 during a course in SoftUni. 
The purpose for this app it to help people with rare blood group get blood easier. People can register in the app and tell some information about themselves and also which blood group are they. Then they can see all blood centers that are registered. They can apply for a request that is post in a center. There are 3 roles: SystemAdmin, CenterAdmin and User. SystemAdmin can add new centers and add new admins. CenterAdmin can make requests and add new centerAdmins. When a request is made, a notification and an email are send to all users that can donate that group and haven't donated last 3 months. Users can also send messages to the centers.
